They may use any weapon and may wear any armor, but note that some of the Ranger’s special talents and abilities are unavailable when wearing heavier than leather armor.

With the GM's permission, the list might include rival organizations, nations, or similar agencies. \n\nRangers are always expert bowmen. When using any regular bow (shortbow or longbow, but not crossbow), a Ranger adds +2 to his or her Attack Bonus. At 5th level, a Ranger may fire three arrows every two rounds (a 3/2 rate of fire).

Of course, the room beyond the door might really be silent; thus, the Game Master must make the roll, so that a roll of 1 in such a case will not give anything away to the players.\n\nA secret door is found on a roll of 1 on 1d6; characters with 15 or higher Intelligence succeed on a roll of 1-2. Under normal conditions, searching for secret doors takes one turn per character per 10 feet of wall searched. Also, as noted previously, Elves add 1 to the range automatically, such that an Elf discovers secret doors on a 1-2 on 1d6, or 1-3 if the Elf has an Intelligence of 15 or higher. The GM may create secret doors that are more difficult (or easier) to detect at their option.\n\nMultiple characters searching for secret doors ensures that any such will eventually be found; however, if the first and second searchers fail, the next searcher must take two turns to search, and all subsequent searches of the area require an hour.\n\nNote that finding a secret door does not grant understanding of how it works.

For instance, a save vs. Death Ray is often used to avoid falling into a covered pit (with Dexterity bonus added), while spear-throwers, automated crossbows, and the like are sometimes treated as if they were monsters, attacking vs. the victim's Armor Class at some given attack bonus.\n\nNormal characters have a chance equal to a roll of 1 on 1d6 to detect a trap if a search for one is made.

A Dwarven Thief is a special case; apply whichever trap-detection ability is higher. In all cases, a search for traps takes at least a turn per 10' square area.

Cover or concealment makes it more difficult to strike an intended target, and thus a penalty will be applied to the attacker's die roll depending upon how much of the target is protected from attack. For concealment, the attack penalty should range from -1 (25% obscured) to -4 (90% obscured). For hard cover, these penalties should be doubled.",

In addition, an affected spell caster loses access to one of their highest-level spell slots. The victim may or may not be allowed a saving throw to resist the effect (depending on the specific monster type).\n\nIf the character's hit points are reduced to zero or less by means of energy drain, the victim is immediately slain. If the energy drain is caused by an undead monster, the victim will usually be transformed into that sort of undead (exact details vary by type of monster). Negative levels may be removed by magic, such as the restoration spell. When a negative level is to be removed, divide the total number of hit points lost by the number of negative levels (rounding normally) to determine how many hit points are restored.\n\nFor example, a character suffers three negative levels of energy drain. The hit point losses rolled were 6, 5, and 2, for a total of 13 points lost. The first negative level removed restores 13 / 3 = 4.3333 hit points (which is rounded to 4 even). Now the character has two negative levels and has lost 9 hit points. The next time a negative level is removed, the character recovers 9 / 2 = 4.5 hit points, which is rounded to 5 even. Now the character has one negative level and 4 hit points lost. Removal of the last negative level will restore the remaining 4 points.\n\nThose who have suffered energy drain generally have a gaunt, haggard look about them, noticeable by observant characters.",

      "description": "Saving throws represent the ability of a character or creature to resist or avoid special attacks, such as spells or poisons. \n\nSaving throws are made by rolling a d20 against a target number based on the character's class and level; for monsters, a comparable class and level are provided for the purpose of determining the monster's saving throw figures. As with attack rolls, a natural (unadjusted) roll of 20 is always a success, and a natural 1 is always a failure.\n\nThe five categories of saving throw as follows: <span class=\"hotpink\">Death Ray or Poison, Magic Wands, Paralysis or Petrify, Dragon Breath, and Spells</span>. Spells and monster special attacks will indicate which category applies (when a saving throw is allowed), but in some unusual situations the Game Master will need to choose a category. \n\nOne way to make this choice is to interpret the categories metaphorically. For example, a GM might be writing an adventure wherein there is a trap that pours burning oil on the hapless adventurers. Avoiding the oil might be considered similar to avoiding Dragon Breath. Or perhaps a stone idol shoots beams of energy from its glaring eyes when approached. This attack may be considered similar to a Magic Wand, or if especially potent, a Spell. The saving throw vs. Death Ray is often used as a \"catch all\" save versus many of the \"ordinary\" dangers encountered in a dungeon environment. \n\nIn general, saving throw rolls are not adjusted by ability score bonus or penalty figures. There are a few exceptions: \n\n• Poison saving throws are adjusted by the character's Constitution modifier. \n\n• Saving throws against illusions (such as phantasmal force) are adjusted by the character's Intelligence modifier. \n\n• Saving throws against charm spells (and other forms of mind control) are adjusted by the character's Wisdom modifier. The GM may decide on other saving throw adjustments as they see fit. \n\n<span class=\"cyan\">Item Saving Throws</span>\n\nArea effects (such as fireball or lightning bolt spells) may damage items carried by a character as well as injuring the character. For simplicity, assume that items carried are unaffected if the character or creature carrying them makes their own saving throw. However, very fragile items (paper vs. fire, glass vs. physical impact, etc.) may still be considered subject to damage even if the bearer makes their save. In any case where one or more items may be subject to damage, use the saving throw roll of the bearer to determine if the item is damaged or not. For example, if a character holding an open spellbook is struck by a fireball spell, they must save vs. Spells, and then save again at the same odds for the spellbook. The GM should feel free to amend this rule as they wish; for instance, a backpack full of fragile items might be given a single saving throw rather than laboriously rolling for each and every item.",

(The Hit Dice row is provided for use with undead monsters not found in the Core Rules; only use the Hit Dice row if the specific type of undead monster is not on the table and no guidance is given in the monster's description. Note that the hit dice given are not necessarily the same as the hit dice of the monster given for that column.) If the table indicates \"No\" for that combination, it is not possible for the Cleric to affect that type of undead monster. If the table gives a number, that is the minimum number needed on 1d20 to Turn that type of undead. If the table says \"T\" for that combination, that type of undead is automatically affected (no roll needed). If the result shown is a \"D,\" then that type of undead will be Damaged (and possibly destroyed) rather than Turned.\n\nIf the roll is a success, 2d6 hit dice of undead monsters are affected; surplus hit dice are lost (so if zombies are being Turned and a roll of 7 is made, at most 3 zombies can be Turned), but a minimum of one creature will always be affected if the first roll succeeds. \n\nIf a mixed group of undead (say, a wight and a pair of zombies) is to be Turned, the player still rolls just once. The result is checked against the weakest sort first (the zombies), and if they are successfully Turned, the same result is checked against the next higher type of undead.\n\nLikewise, the 2d6 hit dice are rolled only once. \n\nFor example, if the group described above is to be Turned by a 2nd level Cleric, they would first need to have rolled a 15 or higher to Turn the zombies. \n\nIf this is a success, 2d6 are rolled; assuming the 2d6 roll is a 7, this would Turn both zombies and leave a remainder of 3 hit dice of effect. Wights are, in fact, 3 hit die monsters, so assuming the original 1d20 roll was a 20, the wight is Turned as well. \n\nObviously, were it a group of 3 zombies and a wight, the 2d6 roll would have to be a total of 9 or higher to affect them all. \n\nIf a Cleric succeeds at Turning the undead, but not all undead monsters present are affected, they may try again in the next round to affect those which remain. \n\nIf any roll to Turn the Undead fails, that Cleric may not attempt to Turn Undead again for one full turn. A partial failure (possible against a mixed group) counts as a failure for this purpose. \n\nUndead monsters which are Turned flee from the Cleric and their party at maximum movement. \n\nIf the party pursue and corner the Turned undead, they may resume attacking the party; but if left alone, the monsters will not return or attempt to attack the Cleric or those near them for at least 2d4 turns. \n\nUndead monsters subject to a D (Damaged) result suffer 1d8 damage per level of the Cleric (roll once and apply the same damage to all undead monsters affected); those reduced to zero hit points are utterly destroyed, being blasted into little more than dust.

      "description": "Crossbows are essentially short, heavy bows (laths) of wood or metal set across a stock or tiller. Much of the popularity of the crossbow comes from its ease in use – and much shorter training time for men-at-arms – compared to bows. The mechanical lock & pulling mechanisms means higher tensions can be drawn and held without tiring the archer. This allows for ready fire, and with greater ranges than a regular bow, at the expense of a slower rate of fire. Hand Crossbows are something of a novelty – rare, fairly delicate, and difficult to craft.  They are easy to draw and set (firing once per round), but have short range and less penetration (damage) compared to the heavier models.  Their small size and ease of use makes these popular for assassination using poisoned bolts.  As the name suggests, these can be wielded with one hand.  The short bolts require a special-sized bolt case.",

These small embedded plates offer excellent coverage and better protection than regular chain mail at the price of additional weight and less flexibility. This also covers other types of ‘‘enhanced’ chainmail, such as a lamellar cuirass, or Mail and Plate armors without a full breastplate.",

Some hurled weapons may be usable in melee, but with a -2 to strike. Nets are only used to snare opponents.  A net for combat use is typically about 10' feet in diameter, with a series of weights around the edges to help spread the net in flight, and hold down the edges to better trap targets.  On a successful hit, the target must save vs. Death Ray or be caught.  It will take 1d4+1 rounds to get free, or 1 round if they can be cut free.  Strong creatures may attempt to tear the net apart.  This is similar to a Strength check against a locked door to tear free.  A net can normally only catch a single man-sized target when thrown.  Larger nets tend to be difficult to manage in combat, but make excellent traps.  Nets can be used in melee, but only to attempt to tangle a weapon.  It must be thrown to capture a target.\n",

The cup on a length of cord is most common, but also includes short levers and elastic-powered devices. Depending on the exact design, most slings can be “\"fired”\" one-handed, but take two hands to load. Sling Bullets are shaped, typically metal (lead, bronze), and roughly marble-sized. Stones are often chosen for shape and weight (and fairly easily found while traveling, particularly around rivers). A sling may be used to hurl small, roundish objects (gems, eggs, tiny jars), but with diminished range and accuracy.",

      "description": "This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of \"evil\" is left to the individual GM to decide. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are \"evil\" or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that \"good\" creatures are kept away, rather than \"evil\" creatures. ",

This level, hit dice, or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means, though of course the character may gain levels and hit dice in the normal fashion.

Note that, if the victim has fewer hit points remaining than the number rolled, he or she will take at least one point of damage (and this is the only case in which harm may kill a creature). Generally, both heal and harm only affect living creatures. If used against an undead creature, heal instead acts like harm; likewise, harm affects undead like heal. Constructs such as golems are unaffected by either spell. ",

The disc floats level to the ground, at about the height of the caster's waist. It remains still when within 10' of the caster, and follows at the caster's movement rate if he or she moves away from it. The floating disc can be pushed as needed to position it but will be dispelled if somehow moved more than 10' from the caster.

The voice will resemble the caster's, but will not be identical. The mouth cannot use command words or activate magical effects. It does, however, move according to the words articulated; if it were placed upon a statue, the mouth of the statue would move and appear to speak. Of course, magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, or any other object. The spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to the caster's command as set in the spell. Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Disguises and illusions can fool them. Normal darkness does not defeat a visual trigger, but magical darkness or invisibility does. Silent movement or magical silence defeats audible triggers. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises or to a specific noise or spoken word. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. A magic mouth cannot distinguish level, hit dice, or class except by external garb. The range limit of a trigger is 10 feet per caster level, so a 6th-level caster can command a magic mouth to respond to triggers as far as 60 feet away.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Note that the definition of \"evil\" is left to the individual GM to decide. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a magic jar attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including charm spells or effects). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the protection from evil effect. If the protection from evil effect ends before the effect granting control does, the would-be controller would then be able to command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures (regardless of whether they are \"evil\" or not). This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Reversed, this spell becomes protection from good. It functions in all ways as described above, save that \"good\" creatures are kept away, rather than \"evil\" creatures. ",

These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears; within this limitation, the caster may choose any arrangement of webs he or she wishes, up to the limit of range and the given 8,000 cubic foot volume. The caster may choose to create a smaller volume if he or she wishes. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won't cause the attacker to become entangled, but moving through the affected area will. Anyone in the area of effect when the spell is cast must make a save vs. Death Ray. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is reduced to one-half normal movement rate. Such entangled creatures may not cast spells or perform normal attacks; whether other actions are possible is left to the GM to decide. Once an entangled creature leaves the area of effect of the web, it will be able to act normally again. If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can't move or perform any other physical action. Speech remains possible, however. Creatures with Strength of 13 or higher (or 4 or more hit dice) may be able to break loose, however; each round, such creatures are allowed another save vs. Death Ray with results as given above. Creatures failing the initial save and having Strength of 12 or less (or fewer than 4 hit dice) are trapped until the duration expires or the webs are otherwise removed. The strands of a web spell are flammable. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away a 10' cube in 1 round; the fire will spread to adjacent 10' cubes each round until all the webbing is consumed (or the fire is put out by some means).

Failure to take over the host leaves the caster's life force in the magic jar, and that target creature is immune to further attempts for the duration of the spell. If the caster is successful, his or her life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the magic jar. The caster keeps his or her Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, attack bonus, saving throws, and mental abilities (including spellcasting ability). The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, and natural abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow the caster to make more attacks than normal. The caster does not have access to any extraordinary or supernatural abilities of the body. If the caster's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken (whether by dispel magic or physical damage): If the jar is in range of the caster's body, the caster's spirit returns to its body. Otherwise, the caster's spirit departs (the caster dies). In either case, the spell ends. If the caster's spirit is driven from the host body by dispel evil: If the magic jar is in range of the host body, the caster's spirit returns to the jar, and the host's spirit returns to its body. The caster will not be able to possess the same host again for the remaining duration of the spell. If the magic jar is not in range of the host body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit is freed from the jar (and departs), and the host's body dies. If the host's spirit is in the magic jar, and the jar is broken: If the jar is in range of the host's body, the caster's spirit departs, the host's spirit returns to its body, and the spell ends. Otherwise, the host's spirit departs, and the caster's spirit is stranded in the host body. Note here that the spell has not ended. Dispel evil can still be used to drive the caster's spirit from the body, which departs as noted, ending the spell. In any case where the spell ends with the caster's body unoccupied by a spirit, that body does truly die. ",

The caster can bring along objects or creatures, not to exceed 300 pounds plus 100 pounds per level above 10th. The caster must be in contact with all objects and/or creatures to be transported (although creatures to be transported may be in contact with one another, with at least one of those creatures in contact with the caster). Unwilling creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. Spells to resist the spell, and the caster may need to make an attack roll to make contact with such a creature. Likewise, a creature's save vs. Spells prevents items in its possession from being teleported. The caster must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer the mental image, the more likely it is that the teleportation will work. Areas of strong magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible. To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the table below. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table. Familiarity: \"Very familiar\" is a place where the caster has been very often and feels at home. \"Studied carefully\" is a place the caster knows well, either because it can currently be seen, the caster has been there often, or other means (such as scrying) have been used to study the place for at least one hour. \"Seen casually\" is a place that the caster has seen more than once but with which he or she is not very familiar. \"Viewed once\" is a place that the caster has seen once, possibly using magic. \"False destination\" is a place that does not truly exist or if the caster is teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar. When rolling on this row, use 1d20+80. On Target: The caster appears exactly where desired. Off Target: The caster appears safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly. Similar Area: The caster winds up in an area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. This means that the caster appears in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell's range, the spell simply fails instead. Mishap: The caster and anyone else teleporting with the caster have gotten \"scrambled.\" Each takes 1d10 points of damage; then reroll on the chart to see where they wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time \"Mishap\" comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll. ",

The caster can create a wall of stone in almost any shape he or she desires.

It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp. For this use, if the span is more than 20 feet, the wall must be arched and buttressed, reducing the spell's area by half. The wall can also be crudely shaped to create crenelations, battlements, and so forth by similarly reducing the area. Like any other stone wall, this one can be destroyed by a disintegrate spell or by normal means such as breaking and chipping.

While a geas cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity. A saving throw vs. Spells will allow an unwilling target to resist a geas when it is first cast. However, the target may choose to accept the geas, typically as part of a bargain with the caster to perform some service. The geased creature must follow the given instructions until the geas is completed, no matter how long it takes. If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his or her own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of one day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions, at the GM's discretion. For every 24 hours that the subject chooses not to obey the geas (or is prevented from obeying it), it suffers a -2 penalty to each of its ability scores, up to a total of -8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 3 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the geas. A geas (and all effects thereof) can be ended by a remove curse spell, or by a wish, or by the reverse of this spell. Dispel magic does not affect a geas. ",

If the subject's soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work. Roll on the following table to determine what sort of creature the character becomes. Since the dead character is returning in a new body, all physical ills and afflictions are repaired. The condition of the remains is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the character's body still exists, it can be reincarnated, but the portion receiving the spell must have been part of the character's body at the time of death. The magic of the spell creates an entirely new young adult body for the soul to inhabit from the natural elements at hand. This process takes one hour to complete. When the body is ready, the subject is reincarnated. A reincarnated character recalls the majority of its former life and form. Its class is unchanged, as are the character's Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores should be rerolled. (If the character's ability scores are outside the allowable range for the new form, they should be adjusted up or down by the GM as needed.) The subject's level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by 1; this is a real reduction, not a negative level, and is not subject to magical restoration. Roll one hit die and subtract the total from the character's original hit point total; this is the new form's hit points. If the subject was 1st level, instead of a hit point reduction, its new Constitution score is reduced by 2. A character that has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can't be returned to life by this spell. Constructs, elementals, and undead creatures can't be reincarnated. The spell cannot bring back a creature who has died of old age. The reincarnated creature gains all abilities associated with its new form, including forms of movement and speeds, natural armor, natural attacks, extraordinary abilities, and the like, but it doesn't automatically speak the language of the new form.

      "description": "This spell causes a flat, vertical iron wall to spring into being. The wall is composed of up to one 10'x10' square section, one inch thick, per caster level. If the caster so desires, the wall can bond itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must always be a flat plane, though the edges can be shaped to fit the available space, and it must always be conjured in contact with the ground. The caster can increase the thickness of the wall with a proportionate reduction in the area; for example, doubling the thickness halved the area. The wall may not be made less than one inch thick. The caster can create the wall vertically resting on a flat surface but not attached to the surface, so that it can be tipped over to fall on and crush creatures beneath it. The wall is 50% likely to tip in either direction if left un-pushed. Creatures can push the wall in one direction rather than letting it fall randomly. A creature with 13 Strength (or 4 or more Hit Dice) can push the wall over; or several creatures can work together to do so. (If the optional Ability Roll rule is being used, a Strength roll at -3 is sufficient to topple the wall.) Creatures with room to flee the falling wall may do so by making successful saves vs. Death Ray (with Dexterity bonus added). Any creature of Ogre-size or smaller that fails the save takes 10d6 points of damage. The wall cannot crush larger creatures. Like any iron wall, this wall is subject to rust, perforation, and other natural phenomena. ",

      "description": "Black bears, renowned for their versatility as omnivores, have a varied diet that includes nuts, berries, insects, small mammals, and occasionally carrion. Their adaptability allows them to thrive in diverse habitats, ranging from dense forests to mountainous regions and even suburban areas. Despite their formidable size and strength, black bears are generally solitary and elusive, preferring to avoid confrontations with humans.\n\nHowever, when a female black bear senses a threat to her cubs, her maternal instinct kicks in, and she becomes exceptionally defensive. In such situations, she will not hesitate to confront potential threats, displaying aggressive behavior to protect her offspring. This defensive behavior can manifest in vocalizations, such as huffing or growling, as well as physical displays like charging or swiping with her claws.\n\nIt's important to note that black bears typically prefer to avoid conflicts with humans and will often retreat if given the opportunity. Understanding their behavior and respecting their space is key to minimizing encounters and ensuring the safety of both humans and bears in shared habitats.",

Standing on all fours, they loom as high as six feet at the shoulder, casting an imposing presence in their domain. Unlike their more docile relatives, cave bears are ferocious predators, renowned for their relentless aggression towards any creature deemed prey.\n\nTheir massive size and muscular build afford cave bears a formidable advantage in the wild. Armed with powerful claws and jaws capable of crushing bone, they are fearsome hunters capable of taking down prey much larger than themselves. From deer to smaller predators and even unwary humans, few creatures are safe from the wrath of a hungry cave bear.\n\nDespite their intimidating appearance and predatory instincts, cave bears are not mindless killers. Like all apex predators, they possess a keen intelligence honed by years of survival in their harsh environments. They are cunning hunters, employing stealth and ambush tactics to secure their next meal.\n\nEncounters with cave bears are a harrowing experience for any traveler brave or foolish enough to venture into their territory. Their roars echo through the caverns they call home, striking fear into the hearts of those who dare to cross their path. Surviving an encounter with a cave bear requires quick thinking, resourcefulness, and a healthy dose of luck, for few adversaries can match the sheer power and ferocity of these monstrous beasts",

      "description": "Brown bears, also known as grizzly bears in certain regions, are imposing creatures of the wild renowned for their formidable size, carnivorous diet, and aggressive demeanor. Adult males typically weigh between 400 to 800 pounds, standing an impressive four feet tall at the shoulder. Females, while slightly smaller in stature, are no less formidable and share the same bloodthirsty nature as their male counterparts.\n\nThese apex predators command respect in their ecosystems, possessing immense strength and powerful jaws lined with sharp teeth and claws. With their keen sense of smell and acute hearing, brown bears are skilled hunters capable of taking down prey as large as moose or bison. Despite their omnivorous diet, which includes vegetation such as berries and roots, meat forms a significant portion of their sustenance, particularly during the salmon runs in regions like Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.\n\nWhile brown bears are often portrayed as solitary creatures, they are not averse to defending their territories or asserting dominance over rivals. During the mating season or when confronted with threats to their food sources or offspring, these bears can become highly aggressive, displaying intimidating behaviors such as charging, growling, and even standing on their hind legs to appear more imposing.\n\nEncounters with brown bears in the wild demand caution and respect, as provoking or startling these powerful animals can have deadly consequences. Understanding their behaviors and adhering to proper safety protocols, such as storing food securely and making noise while hiking in bear country, are essential for minimizing conflicts and ensuring the safety of both humans and bears alike.",

      "description": "Polar bears, native to the icy realms of the far northern regions, stand as majestic yet formidable predators of the Arctic. Towering over their brown bear counterparts, they are larger and possess a robust build, making them one of the largest bear species on Earth. With their sleek white fur camouflaging them against the snow and ice, polar bears blend seamlessly into their frigid surroundings as they prowl the frozen landscapes in search of prey.\n\nThese apex predators are renowned for their raw power and predatory prowess. With males weighing up to 1,500 pounds and standing over ten feet tall when on their hind legs, and females not far behind, polar bears command respect in their harsh environment. Despite their seemingly docile appearance while resting on the ice, polar bears are just as hostile and aggressive as their brown bear relatives, particularly when hungry or protecting their young.\n\nWith their acute sense of smell and keen hunting instincts, polar bears primarily prey on seals, which they hunt by stalking them at breathing holes or ambushing them near seal pupping grounds. However, as opportunistic feeders, they will scavenge on carcasses, hunt smaller mammals, and even feed on vegetation when necessary.\n\nEncounters with polar bears are rare but potentially dangerous for humans venturing into their habitat. As top predators with no natural enemies, polar bears may perceive humans as potential prey or threats, leading to confrontations. Understanding polar bear behavior and taking appropriate precautions, such as traveling in groups, carrying bear deterrents, and maintaining a safe distance, are crucial for ensuring safety in polar bear territory.",

They are characterized by their slender build, long legs, and distinctive horns, which vary in shape and size among different species. Antelopes exhibit remarkable adaptability to their environments, ranging from the iconic herds of the African plains to the rugged mountainous terrain of their habitats.\n\nThese herbivores play a vital role in their ecosystems as grazers, feeding on a variety of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Their feeding habits help maintain the balance of plant populations and contribute to the overall health of their habitats. Antelopes have evolved sophisticated social structures and communication systems to navigate their environments and coordinate group behaviors, such as migration and predator evasion.\n\nDuring the breeding season, male antelopes often engage in fierce competitions for mating rights, displaying impressive prowess and stamina in battles with rival males. These contests may involve clashes of horns, vocalizations, and elaborate displays of dominance. Female antelopes give birth to single offspring after a gestation period of several months, typically seeking out concealed locations to protect their vulnerable young from predators.",

      "description": "Deer are graceful and elegant herbivores found in various habitats across the world. They are known for their slender bodies, long legs, and branching antlers (in males of most species). Adult deer typically stand around 3 to 5 feet tall at the shoulder, with males generally larger and more robust than females. Their coat coloration varies depending on the species and the environment they inhabit, ranging from reddish-brown to gray or even white in some cases.\n\nDeer are primarily crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk, although they may be spotted foraging at other times of the day. They have keen senses, particularly their hearing and sense of smell, which they rely on to detect predators and other threats. When startled or threatened, deer can swiftly flee with remarkable speed and agility, bounding gracefully through their woodland habitats.\n\nDuring mating season, known as the rut, males engage in impressive displays of dominance and aggression to compete for mating rights with females. This often involves vocalizations, posturing, and clashes between rival males using their antlers. Female deer, known as does, give birth to one or two fawns after a gestation period of around six to seven months. Fawns are born with white spots on their reddish-brown coat, providing them with camouflage in their forest surroundings.\n\nDeer are primarily browsers, feeding on a variety of vegetation including grasses, leaves, shoots, and twigs. They play a crucial role in shaping the ecosystems they inhabit through their feeding habits and interactions with plant communities.\n\nIn folklore and mythology, deer are often associated with qualities such as grace, gentleness, and swiftness, and they hold symbolic significance in many cultures around the world.",

They are notable for their large size, with adult males, known as bulls, standing around 5 to 5.5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing up to 700 pounds or more. Females, called cows, are slightly smaller and lack the impressive antlers of the males. Elk are distinguishable by their reddish-brown coats, which darken in color during the winter months, and their broad, branching antlers, which can span up to 4 feet in width. These antlers are shed and regrown annually, with the size and intricacy of the antlers serving as a display of dominance and breeding fitness among males.\n\nElk are primarily crepuscular, like deer, and are most active during dawn and dusk. They inhabit a range of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and alpine meadows, where they feed on a diverse diet of grasses, shrubs, and tree bark. Their keen senses of smell and hearing aid in detecting predators, while their swift running speeds and powerful hooves provide defense against threats.\n\nDuring the rutting season in the fall, male elk engage in fierce battles for dominance and mating rights. These contests involve vocalizations, posturing, and clashes of antlers, with the victor earning the privilege to mate with receptive females. Female elk give birth to a single calf in the spring, which they protect fiercely from predators.\n\nElk hold significant cultural and ecological importance in the regions they inhabit, featuring prominently in Native American folklore and playing key roles in maintaining the balance of ecosystems through their grazing habits and interactions with other wildlife species.",

      "description": "Moose, the largest member of the deer family, are iconic herbivores found in the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. These majestic creatures are renowned for their towering stature, with adult males, known as bulls, standing up to 6 to 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighing as much as 1,500 pounds or more. Females, called cows, are slightly smaller in size but still impressive compared to other deer species. Moose are characterized by their dark brown coats, long legs, and broad, palmate antlers, which can span up to 6 feet in width. Their antlers are shed and regrown annually, with the largest individuals sporting impressive racks that serve as a display of dominance and breeding prowess.\n\nMoose are primarily solitary animals, though they may form loose aggregations during the breeding season or in areas with abundant food resources. They inhabit a variety of ecosystems, including boreal forests, marshlands, and tundra, where they feed on a diverse diet of aquatic vegetation, twigs, leaves, and grasses. Their large, bulbous noses and specialized lips allow them to forage underwater for aquatic plants, making them well-adapted to their watery habitats.\n\nDespite their massive size, moose are surprisingly agile and can navigate through dense vegetation and snow with ease. They have keen senses of smell and hearing, which they use to detect predators such as wolves and bears. When threatened, moose can be formidable adversaries, using their powerful hooves and sharp antlers to defend themselves and their young.\n\nIn Native American folklore and mythology, moose often feature as symbols of strength, resilience, and endurance, revered for their majestic presence in the wilderness. They play an important ecological role in their ecosystems, shaping vegetation communities through their browsing habits and providing a vital food source for predators.",

Their skin tone ranges from a greenish tan to a grayish brown, and their hair and eyes are usually dark. Most wear toughened hides and carry wooden shields for armor. Like most goblinoids, they have Darkvision with a range of 30 feet.\n\nTribes of hobgoblins prefer to live in walled villages, or preferably in castles, and are quite willing to overrun villages or castles built by other races rather than build their own. Some tribes do choose to live underground. Hobgoblins are well-known for their animosity towards elves and will attack them whenever they think they can win.\n\nOne out of every six hobgoblins will be a warrior of 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Regular hobgoblins gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In hobgoblin lairs, one out of every twelve will be a chieftain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) wearing chainmail with an Armor Class of 15 (11) and a movement of 20 feet, having a +1 bonus to damage due to strength. In lairs of 30 or more, there will be a hobgoblin king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with a shield for an Armor Class of 16 (11), and having a +2 bonus to damage. In the lair, hobgoblins never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive.\n\nIn addition, a lair has a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman being present (or 1-3 on 1d6 if a hobgoblin king is present), and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock.

Faced with enemies attacking from one direction, a giant bombardier beetle may choose to turn away and use the spray attack rather than biting.\n\nGiant bombardier beetles, like most beetles, have about the same visual acuity in all directions, and thus suffer no penalty to Armor Class when attacked from behind.",

      "description": "A basilisk is a giant six-legged lizard-like monster that petrifies living creatures with its gaze. It has dark brown, green, or black skin on its back and a pale yellow or white belly. Adults reach a body length of 5 to 7 feet with a tail of roughly equal length, and a weight of 250 to 400 pounds. There is no particular difference in size between males and females.\n\nAny living creature meeting the gaze of a basilisk must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone instantly. In general, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2 to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight the monster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its own reflection in a mirror, it must save vs. Petrify or be turned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power to petrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed. However, if an attacker can manage to surprise the monster with a mirror, it may see its reflection.\n\nThe greater basilisk appears identical to the common variety, save that it is larger, having a body length of about 8 feet with a 7 to 9-foot-long tail and weighing between 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greater basilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any living creature bitten by one or who touches one with bare skin must save vs. Poison or die. This effect persists even after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20 hours. The only way to tell if the effect has subsided is to touch the corpse, an obviously bad idea.",
