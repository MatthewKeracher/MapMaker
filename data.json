A cat, indifferent to the ceaseless activity, stretches lazily on a bale of hay in the corner, occasionally batting at a stray grain. The comforting sound of trickling water, diverted from the nearby stream, underscores the entire atmosphere.\n\nIn one corner, a miller tends to the controls, deftly adjusting the flow of water or wind to optimize the milling process. The wooden floor is worn and slightly uneven, testament to the countless feet that have trodden this path over the years.\n\nBundles of grain, ready for processing, are suspended from the ceiling to dry. The walls are adorned with tools of the trade – hand rakes, shovels, and oil lamps. A wooden ladder leads to an upper level, likely a storage loft for additional supplies.",

His funds consist of a small hoard of gems (3750 g.p. each) and 12 each of s.p. and g.p. for gambling. He is careful to play so as to not be caught cheating, and he makes a modest living thus, mostly skinning passing merchants.\n\nIf offered a chance to adventure, Furnok will be willing to go along for an equal share - plus all he surreptitiously lifts (particularly magic items which he covets). To show his good faith, however, he will put up his scroll, hoping to parlay it into a more. If the worst should come, he has a +1 dagger hidden in his boot.",

The fighter is neutral (for he isn't bright enough to be any alignment), while Turuko is lawful evil. The monk believes himself to be highly clever, and his plan is to waylay and rob adventurers returning from a successful expedition to the ruined moathouse, for he knows that there are monsters and treasure there.\n\nThe pair will accompany a small party, hang back in fights, and then slay the expedition when it is weak. Otherwise, they will spy on a large group, and attack only if it is reduced by death and wounds. They currently have only 12 g.p., 5 s.p., and 40 c.p. between them, and something must be done soon, says Turuko.",

Piles of crates, barrels, and hogsheads nestle among rusty implements and timeworn artifacts. It's a place where history and utility coexist, where an old wheelbarrow rubs shoulders with relics of a bygone era. Dominating one corner is a sizable stack of cordwood, providing a visual reminder of the comfort and warmth the hostel's fireplaces bring to its patrons.\n\nWithin this cavernous space, an array of vessels—kegs, barrels, hogsheads, pipes, butts, and tuns—await their next purpose. Among them, three immense casks stand out, each with its own story to tell. Two of these colossal containers still harbor remnants of their former occupants, a rich and lingering residue of wine that clings to the inner walls. The third cask sits empty, a silent witness to past revelries.\n\nAn ingenious system of access has been employed here. A section of the side of each cask is hinged, allowing entry into its interior. The mere push of a hidden catch transforms the cask's farend into a makeshift door, swinging inward to reveal another secret. An additional door, hidden within the very wall, becomes accessible when triggered by the insertion of a dagger blade into a well-concealed crock in the fieldstone wall. This intricate arrangement of hidden compartments and passages might serve as a testament to the innkeeper's proclivity for secrecy and surprise.\n\nBeneath the hustle and bustle of the upper floors, the ashpit quietly collects the remnants of fires that blaze in hearths above. Swept down through a chute, the accumulated ash and soot create a granular mound, awaiting the moment of its transformation. Gathered periodically, these once-fiery remnants find new purpose as ingredients for soap-making or as nourishment for the soil\n\nThe practicality of the ashpit extends beyond mere disposal. Not only do the ashes from the inn's other fireplaces find their way here, but also a grinder and separator mechanism lies in wait. This place, constructed predominantly from stone and iron, minimizes the risk of fire hazards. The unique inclusion of this area serves as an enticing enigma for curious adventurers, tempting them to uncover hidden treasures or secrets lurking within its depths.",

Concealed within the shadows, this crawl space is marked by a flooring of stones overlaid by a layer of soil, contributing to the room's impressive soundproofing capabilities.\n\nIn the echoes of time, the secret room may have fallen into disuse, but its stories and ambiance linger on, testifying to the indomitable spirit of those who once sought solace and strategy within its protective confines.",

A weathered wooden table stretches across the hall, adorned with a worn, linen tablecloth that drapes gracefully to the stone floor. The flickering light of candles in ornate brass holders casts a warm, golden glow over the tableau.\n\nAt the center of the table lies a substantial wooden trencher, serving as both plate and platter. Surrounding it are pewter and wooden plates, each bearing a selection of simple but wholesome fare. Roasted fowl, with crispy skin glistening, sits beside a fragrant, herb-stuffed boar. Loaves of crusty bread, some still warm, beckon from a woven basket.\n\nTankards of frothy ale and goblets of rich red wine are strategically placed, while mead and cider in clay vessels offer additional options. A medley of root vegetables and hearty greens spills from wooden bowls, adding bursts of color to the rustic setting.\n\nThe air is redolent with the mingling aromas of roasted meats, savory stews, and freshly baked bread. A bowl of seasonal fruits, displaying vibrant hues of red and gold, serves as a decorative centerpiece.\n\nSeated around the table are wooden benches, their surfaces worn smooth by the countless gatherings of friends and kin.}",

  "townText": "The Village of Hommlet -- Hommlet as it is commonly called -- is situated in the central part of the Flanaess, that portion of eastern Oerik Continent which is known and \"civilised\". The village (actually hamlet-sized, though local parlance distinguished it with the term \"village\") is located some 10 or so leagues southeast of the town of Verbobonc, on the fringe of the territory controlled by its noble Lord, the Viscount of Verbobonc. \n\nIt is at a crossroads. \n\nTo the north is the mighty Velverdyva River, along whose south bank runs the Lowroad. Many days' travel to the east, on the shores of the Lake of Unknown Depths (Nyr Dyv) is the great walled city of Dyvers, the village of Sobanwych about halfway along the route. Below that to the southeast and east are miles and miles of forest, the Gnarley, beyond which is the Wild Coast, Wooly Bay, and the Sea of Gearnat. \n\nThe road south forks a league or so beyond the little community, one meandering off towards the Wild Coast, the other rolling through the lower Kron Hills to the village of Ostverk and then eventually turning southwards again into the leven Kingdom of Celene. \n\nThe western route leads into the very heart of the gnomish highlands, passing through Greenway Valley about a day's travel distant and going onwards to the Lortmil Mountains far beyond.\n\nHommlet grew from a farm or two, a rest house, and a smithy. The roads brought a sufficient number of travellers and merchant wagons to attracts tradesmen and artisans to serve those passing through. The rest house became a thriving inn, a wheel and wainwright settled in the thorp, and more farmers and herdsmen followed, for grain was needed for the passing animals, and meat was in demand for the innfolk.\n\nProsperity was great, for the lord of the district was mild and taxed but little. Trade was good, and the area was untroubled by war or outlaws or ravaging beasts. The area was too free, too beautiful, too bountiful, at least in the eyes of some.\n\nWhether the evil came west from Dyvers as is claimed by one faction, or crept up out of the forestlands bordering the Wild Coast as others assert, come it did. At first it was only a few thieves and an odd group of bandits molesting the merchant caravans. Then came small bands of humanoids -- kobolds or goblins -- raiding the flocks and herds. Local militia and foresters of the Waldgraf and Ostverk apparently checked, but not stopped, the spread of outlawry and evil.\n\nA collection of hovels and their slovenly inhabitants formed the nucleus for the troubles and which were to increase. A wicked cleric established a small chapel at this point. The folk of Hommlet tended to ignore Nulb, even thoug it was but six miles distant. The out-of-the-way position was ideal for the fell purposes planned for this settlement, as was its position on a small river flowing into the Velverdyva. The thickets and marshes around Nulb became the lair and hiding place for bandits, brigands, and all sorts of evil men and monsters alike. The chapel grew into a stone temple as its faithful brough in their ill-gotten tithes. \n\nGood folk were robbed, pillaged, enslaved, or worse. In but three years a grim and foreboding fortress surrounded the evil place, and swarms of creatures worshipped and worked their wickedness there. The servants of the Temple of Elemental Evil made Hommlet and the lands for leagues around a mockery of freedom and beauty. \n\nCommerce ceased, crops withered, pestilence was abroad. But the leaders of this cancer were full of hubris, and in their overweaning pride sought to overthrow the good realms of the north who were coming to the rescue of the land being crushed under the tyranny wrought by the evil temple. \n\nA great battle was fought to the east, and when villagers saw streams of ochre-robed men and humanoids fleeing south and west through their community, there was great rejoicing, for they knew that the murderous oppresors had been defeated and driven from the field in panic and rout.\n\nSo great was the slaughter, so complete the victory of good, that the walled stronghold of the Temple of Elemental Evil fell within a fortnight, despite the aid of a terrible demon. The place was ruined and sealed against a further return of such abominations by powerful blessings and magic. Life quickly returned to a semblance of what it had been before the rise of the temple, and in the decade since, the village and surrounidng countryside have in facet become more rich and prosperous than ever before. \n\nA monstrous troll which plagued the place for a time was hunted down by a body of passing adventurers. With its ashes, these fellows returuned a goodly fortune as well, leaving a portion with the villagers to repay them for their losses before going elsewhere to seek their fortunes.\n\nOther adventurers, knowing of the evil that had once resided in the area, came to seek out similar cahces, and not a few did locate remote lairs and find wealth -- just as some never returned at all.\n\nAfter some five years, adventurers stopped coming to the area, as it seemed that no monsters were left to slay, no evil existed gere to be stamped out. For four years thereafter, this seemed true, but then bandits began to ride the roads again -- not frequently, but to some effect. This seemed all too familiar somehow to the good folk of Hommlet, so they sent word to the Viscount that wicked forces might still lurk thereabouts. This informaiton has been spread throughout the countryside, and the news has attracted outsiders to the village once again. Who and what these men are, no one can be quite sure, although all claim to be bent on slaying monsters and bringing peace and security to Hommlet, for deeds speaks more loudly than words, and lies cloak true purposes of the malevolent.
