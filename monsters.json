"description": "The aerial servant is a semi-intelligent form of an air elemental. It is typically encountered only due to conjuration by a cleric, although these creatures roam the ethereal and astral planes and when encountered there can be dimly seen. An aerial servant is normally invisible. Aerial servants do not fight per se, but they are exceedingly strong and very fast. They can carry weights in excess of 10,000 gold pieces, and if they grasp any creature it requires an 18 strength to have any chance of breaking free. For each percentage point score the creature has, there is a like chance to escape the grasp of the aerial servant, i.e. a human with an 18/50% strength has a 50% chance of breaking free of the grasp, and a 00% or 19 indicates automatic breaking of the grasp. They travel at twice the speed of an invisible stalker, and when on the physical plane they are able to achieve surprise on a die roll of 1-4 (out of 6). If the aerial servant is frustrated from completion of its assigned mission it becomes insane, returns to the cleric which sent it forth, and attacks as a double strength invisible stalker. Likewise, if it is encountered ethereally or astrally the aerial servant will typically attack in the same fashion. For further details regarding aerial servants, consult the volume detailing clerical spells."

"description": "The anhkheg burrows through the earth like an earthworm, preferring soil rich in minerals and organic matter. Thus, it will usually be found in forests and choice agricultural land. This causes farmers great consternation, since the anhkheg likes to supplement its earthly diet of soil with a bit of fresh meat, human or otherwise. Since its mouth is not designed to rip and tear meat, its mandibles crush its prey and secrete a digestive enzyme, causing an additional 1-4 points of damage per turn until the prey is completely dissolved. If sorely pressed in battle, it is able to squirt its digestive acids 30 feet once every six hours. However, when it does this, it cannot digest anything for the same length of time, so it usually will bite. A squirt of digestive acid causes 8-32 hit points of damage to the creature struck, half the amount if the creature makes its saving throw. The anhkheg's favorite method of attacking is lying 5-10 feet underneath the ground until its antennae detect a likely victim passing overhead. Then it burrows out directly underneath the prey and grabs it.",

"description": "When giant ants are encountered, it is 90% likely that they will simply be workers. If found in their lair (nest), there will be double the number rolled plus 1 warrior for every 5 workers. The warrior ant has 3 hit dice, does 2-8 hit points of damage with its mandibles, and if it hits with them, it will also attempt to sting for 3-12 points of damage. If a sting hits, a saving throw versus poison must be made; if successful, the victim takes only 1-4 hit points of damage. The queen ant has 10 hit dice, but she neither moves nor attacks. If she is killed, the other ants will become confused (as if they were under the influence of that spell) for six melee rounds and then leave the nest. Treasure held by ants will be found in the chamber of the queen ant. The egg chamber will be guarded by 5-50 workers and 5 warriors. Giant ant eggs have no normal market value.",

However, if its gaze is reflected so that the basilisk sees its own eyes, it will itself be petrified, but this requires light at least equal to bright torchlight and a good, smooth reflector. Basilisks are usually dull brown with yellowish underbellies. Their eyes are glowing pale green. The basilisk is able to see in both the astral and ethereal planes.
