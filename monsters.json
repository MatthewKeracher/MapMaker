Large rocs are about 18 feet long and have wingspans of around 48 feet; giant rocs average 30 feet long and have massive wingspans of around 80 feet. A roc’s plumage is either dark brown or golden from head to tail.

A light load for a normal roc is 150 pounds, while a heavy load is 300 pounds. Obviously only the smallest characters can hope to ride upon a normal roc. For a large roc, a light load is up to 600 pounds and a heavy load up to 1200. Giant rocs can easily lift up to 3000 pounds, and are heavily loaded when carrying up to 6000 pounds. Tales of giant rocs carrying off full-grown elephants are somewhat exaggerated, but note that a young elephant would be reasonable prey for these monstrous birds. A roc attacks from the air, swooping earthward to snatch prey in its powerful talons and carry it off for itself and its young to devour. Any successful hit with both claw (talon) attacks against a single creature results in that creature being carried off, unless of course the creature is too large for the roc to carry. While being carried, the victim will not be further attacked, so as to be as “fresh” as possible when given to the hatchlings (or consumed by the roc itself if it is solitary). A solitary roc is typically hunting and will attack any man-sized or larger creature that appears edible. A mated pair of rocs attack in concert, fighting to the death to defend their nests or hatchlings."

They are native to another plane where they hunt in packs; sometimes powerful wizards or evil priests summon them for use as watchdogs. In addition to biting, each hellhound may BREATHe fire a number of times per day equal to its hit dice. In combat, one-third of the time (1-2 on 1d6) a hellhound will choose to BREATHe fire; otherwise it will attempt to bite. Roll each round to determine which attack form will be used. A hellhound's BREATH [weapon] is a cone of flame 10' wide at the far end which is 10' long for those with 3 or 4 hit dice, 20' long for those with 5 or 6 hit dice, and 30' long for the largest hellhounds. This BREATH [weapon] does 1d6 points of damage per each hit die of the hellhound to all within the area of effect; a successful saving throw vs. Dragon BREATH reduces damage to half normal. Note that hellhounds vary with regard to the number of hit dice each has. If generating a group randomly, roll 1d6+1 for the hit dice of each, reading a total of 2 as 3.

A wyvern dives from the air,clawing at its opponent with its talons and stinging it todeath. Any living creature hit by the wyvern's stinger mustsave vs. POISON or die. A wyvern can slash with its talonsonly when making a flyby attack or when landing.If a wyvern hits with both its talons, it may attempt to carryoff its victim; only victims weighing 300 pounds or less canbe carried off, and the wyvern can only carry a victim forat most 6 rounds.

Black dragons are more cruel than white dragons, but are still motivated mostly by the urge to live, breed and collect valuable items. Black dragons often choose to hide underwater, leaving only part of the head above the waterline, and leap up suddenly when prey comes within 100' (surprising on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6 in this case). Black dragons are immune to all forms of acid. A black dragon may HOLD its BREATH up to three turns while lying in wait underwater."

The BREATH [weapon] of a sea dragon is a cloud of steam; they are immune to damage from non-magical steam (including the BREATH [weapon] of another sea dragon), and suffer only half damage from magical steam attacks.

Blue dragons lair in vast underground caverns, where they also store their treasure. Although they collect anything that looks valuable, they are most fond of gems, e[special]ly sapphires. Blue dragons are evil monsters, though not so fierce as red dragons. They particularly enjoy tricking intelligent prey into entering their lairs or passing by their hiding places to be ambushed and killed; usually one member of a party attacked by a blue dragon will be left alive for a while, and the dragon will play with that person as a cat plays with a mouse.

They often twine shells and pearl strings in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colourful seaweed. Nixies prefer not to leave their lakes. A nixie stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 45 pounds. Ten or more nixies can work together to cast a powerful charm (similar to charm person). The charm lasts one year (unless di[spell]ed). A save vs. [spell]s is allowed to resist. Each nixie can cast water BREATHing once per day, with a duration of one day. Finally, a group of nixies will often have a school of giant bass living nearby who can be called to their aid (see Fish, Giant Bass for details). Nixies are fey creatures, and thus unpredictable. However, they are rarely malicious, attacking only when they feel threatened."

An adult male is about 15 feet tall and weighs about 2,800 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter, but otherwise identical with males. Frost giants can live to be 250 years old. Frost giants are, first and foremost, cunning. They dislike the smaller races as much as any giant, but rather than attacking outright they will try to use their advantages toconvince those weaker than them to submit. If faced witha stronger force, frost giants will parley or withdraw ifpossible, attacking only if victory seems assured.A frost giant can throw large stones up to 200' for 3d6damage. Frost giants are immune to all ice or cold-basedattacks."

They wear a few pieces of simple but finely crafted jewelry, anklets (favored by barefoot giants), rings, or circlets being most common. They live quiet, reflective lives and spend their time musing about the world, composing and playing music, and tilling their land or gathering food. Storm giants prefer to attack first with their lightning bolts (which work just as the [spell] does, and can be used once per five rounds; a save vs. [spell]s reduces damage to half). Also, 10% of storm giants have the abilities of a Magic User of level 2 to 12 (2d6). In battle, they wear wellcrafted and well-cared-for plate mail.Unlike most other giants, storm giants have been known tobefriend humans, elves, or dwarves."

Males usually wear short, carefully trimmed beards. Gnomes generally wear leather or earth tones, though they decorate their clothes with intricate stitching or fine jewelry. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they live about 350 years. They have Darkvision with a 30' range. When attacked in melee by creatures larger than man-sized, gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their Armor Class. Outdoors in their preferred forest terrain, they are able to hide very effectively; so long as they remain still there is only a 20% chance they will be detected. If one or more gnomes who are successfully hiding attack from ambush, they surprise their foes on 1-4 on 1d6. Gnomes speak their own language, Gnomish, and many know the language of the dwarves. Most gnomes who travel outside gnome lands (as traders or tinkers) know Common, while warriors in gnome settlements usually learn Goblin. Gnomes encountered in the wilderness are likely to be unfriendly, but not hostile. They tolerate dwarves but dislike most other humanoid races. When forced to interact with other races, a gnome will generally be recalcitrant, unless offered a significant amount of treasure. Most gnomes encountered outside their home are warriors; the statistics above are for such. In the lair, for every warrior there will be an average of three civilians having 1-1 Hit Dice and Armor Class 11; such gnomes have Morale of 7. One out of every eight gnome warriors will be a sergeant having 3 Hit Dice (145 XP). Gnomes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a sergeant. Both warriors and sergeants commonly wear chainmail. In gnomish communities, one out of every sixteen warriors will be a captain of 5 Hit Dice (360 XP) with an Armor Class of 16 (11), adding a shield. In addition, in communities of 35 or greater, there will be a king of 7 Hit Dice (670 XP), with an Armor Class of 18 (11), in plate mail and carrying a shield, having a +1 bonus damage due to strength. In their community, gnomes never fail a morale check as long as the king is alive. There is a chance equal to 1-4 on 1d6 that a community will have a Cleric of level 1d6+1, and 1-2 on 1d6 of a Magic-User of level 1d6. Gnomish Clerics and Magic-Users are equivalent to regular gnomish warriors statistically."

Also called “sirens,” mermaids oftenattempt to lure sailors or other men found near the sea.They accomplish this by means of their enchanting songs.A mermaid's song will attract any man within 100 yards,but generally has no effect on women. Men within thearea of effect must save vs. [spell]s to resist, or else they willmove toward the mermaid with amorous intent as directlyas possible. If two mermaids are singing, apply a penaltyof -4 to the save; more than two gives no extra benefit.Affected men will submit to anything the mermaid desires.When she tires of him, he might be freed or slain,depending on the mermaid's temperament.Contrary to popular belief, mermaids are not fish (noreven half fish) and do not BREATHe water. They can HOLDtheir BREATH for up to an hour of light activity, or two turns(20 minutes) of strenuous action. However, being out ofwater more than two turns (20 minutes) causes themermaid 1d4 points of damage per turn.Mermaids can hear as well as dolphins, and can producesounds ranging from the lowest frequency a normalhuman woman can produce up to the highest frequencyof a dolphin. This means that mermaids can learn to communicate with dolphins and whales; at least 35% ofmermaids will know the language of one or the other, and10% can communicate with any such creature.Three-quarters of mermaid births are female. Of thequarter which are male, most have legs rather than tails.Such will either be slain or put ashore to be adopted byhumans, depending on the temperament of the mother.Mermen (those born with tails) are raised to be subservientto the females. A small mermaid community (3d6including the male) will often form around such a mermanand his mother, who becomes their leader. Such a groupis called a pod.One-third of female mermaids are infertile. Othermermaids can sense this, but non-mermaids cannot tell.Infertile mermaids usually remain with a fertile sister (ormore rarely a close friend) to help her ensnare men. Thisexplains the first number appearing given; in any group of2, one will be infertile."

They can change colour at will, and 50% of the time a group can blend into the environment well enough to surprise on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Furthermore, they gain a +2 attack bonus during any surprise round due to their excellent ambush skills. Troglodytes secrete a smelly oil that keeps their scaly skin supple. All mammals (including, of course, all the standard character races) find the scent repulsive, and those within 10 feet of the Troglodyte must make a saving throw versus POISON. Those failing the save suffer a -2 penalty to attack rolls while they remain within range of the Troglodyte. Getting out of range negates the penalty, but renewed exposure reinstates the penalty. The results of the original save last a full 24 hours, after which a new save must be rolled. Troglodytes are very hostile, attacking equal or weaker non-troglodyte groups on sight. They prefer to attack with surprise, depending on their colour-changing ability for this. One out of every eight troglodytes will be a warrior of 4 Hit Dice (240 XP) that gains a +1 bonus to damage due to Strength. Troglodytes gain a +1 bonus to their morale if they are led by a warrior. In lairs of 24 or more, there will be a troglodyte leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) with an Armor Class of 17 and having a +2 bonus to damage due to Strength.

Charmedcreatures can take no actions other than to defendthemselves. A victim within reach of the harpy offers noresistance to the monster’s attacks.

The gaze of a medusa will petrify any creature who meets it unless a save vs. PETRIFICATION is made. In general, any creature surprised by the medusa will meet its gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster while averting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 on attack rolls and -2 to AC. It is safe to view a medusa's reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface; anyone using a mirror to fight a medusa suffers a penalty of -2 to attack and no penalty to AC. If a medusa sees its own reflection, it must save vs. PETRIFICATION itself; a petrified medusa is no longer able to petrify others, but the face of a medusa continues to possess the power to petrify even after death otherwise. Medusae instinctively avoid mirrors or other reflective surfaces, even drinking with theireyes closed, but if an attacker can manage to surprise themonster with a mirror she may see her reflection.Further, the snakes growing from her head are POISONous(save vs. POISON or die in one turn). They attack as agroup, not individually, once per round for 1d6 damage(plus the POISON).A medusa often wears garments that enhance its bodywhile hiding its face behind a hood or veil. A typicalmedusa is 5 to 6 feet tall and about the same weight as ahuman.Medusae are shy and reclusive, owing no doubt to the factthat, once the lair of one is found, any humans livingnearby will not rest until she is slain. They are hatefulcreatures, however, and will seek to destroy as manyhumans as they can without being discovered."

Trolls walkupright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders.Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangleand drag along the ground. For all this seemingawkwardness, trolls are very agile.Trolls have the power of regeneration; they heal 1 hit pointof damage each round after being injured. A troll reducedto 0 hit points is not dead, but only disabled for 2d6rounds, at which point it will regain 1 hit point. Note thatthe troll may “play dead” until it has regenerated further.Damage from fire and acid cannot be regenerated, andmust heal at the normal rate; a troll can only be killed bythis sort of damage. The lower morale rating (inparentheses) is used when the troll faces attackers armedwith fire or acid. If a troll loses a limb or body part, the lost portion regrows in one turn; or, the creature can reattachthe severed member instantly by HOLDing it to the stump.Trolls are hateful creatures, reveling in combat andbloodshed.

An adult goblin stands 3 to 3½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Its eyes are usually bright and crafty-looking, varying in colour from red to yellow. A goblin’s skin colour ranges from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red; usually all members of a single tribe are about the same colour.

The statistics given above are for a standard Goblin in leather armour with a shield; they have a natural Movement rate of 30' and a natural Armor Class of 11.

An adult male gnoll is about 7½ feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Gnolls are nocturnal, and have Darkvision with a 30' range. They are cruel carnivores, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader. One out of every six gnolls will be a hardened warrior of 4Hit Dice (240 XP) having a +1 bonus to damage due tostrength. Gnolls gain a +1 bonus to their morale if theyare led by such a warrior. In lairs of 12 or greater, therewill be a pack leader of 6 Hit Dice (500 XP) having a +2bonus to damage. In the lair, gnolls never fail a moralecheck as long as the pack leader is alive. In addition, a lairhas a chance equal to 1-2 on 1d6 of a shaman beingpresent, and 1 on 1d6 of a witch or warlock. A shaman isequivalent to a hardened warrior statistically, and inaddition has Clerical abilities at level 1d4+1. A witch orwarlock is equivalent to a regular gnoll, and has MagicUser abilities of level 1d4."

Ingeneral, any creature surprised by the basilisk will meetits gaze. Those who attempt to fight the monster whileaverting their eyes suffer penalties of -4 to attack and -2to AC. It is possible to use a mirror to fight themonster, in which case the penalties are -2 to attackand no penalty to AC. If a basilisk sees its ownreflection in a mirror it must save vs. Petrify or beturned to stone; a petrified basilisk loses its power topetrify. Basilisks instinctively avoid mirrors or otherreflective surfaces, even drinking with their eyes closed,but if an attacker can manage to surprise the monsterwith a mirror it may see its reflection.The greater basilisk appears identical to the commonvariety, save that it is larger, having a body length ofabout 8 feet with a 7 to 9 foot long tail and weighingbetween 400 and 750 pounds. The skin of the greaterbasilisk is toxic to the touch, such that any livingcreature bitten by one or who touches one with bareskin must save vs. POISON or die. This effect persistseven after the monster is dead, typically for about 2d20hours; the only way to tell if the effect has subsided is totouch the corpse, an obviously bad idea."

Blood roses can move about slowly, and will try to find locations sheltered from the wind in order to achieve those ideal conditions.

When a cane hits, it wraps around the victim and begins to drain blood, doing 1d6 points of damage per round. A blood rose which has recently (within one day) “eaten” this way will have flowers ranging from pink to deep wine red in colour, which will fade slowly back to white or yellow as the plant digests the blood it has consumed."

Shriekers live in dark, subterranean places. They come in several shades of purple. A shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures monsters to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise. Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds. The sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers learn that the fungus’ noise means there is food nearby. In game terms, the GM should roll a wandering monster check each round that a shrieker shrieks."

As they are superior toghouls, in a mixed group of ghasts and ghouls the GMshould apply Turning effects to the ordinary ghouls first.Humanoids bitten by ghasts may be infected with ghastfever. Each time a humanoid is bitten, there is a 10%chance of the infection being passed. The afflictedhumanoid is allowed to save vs. Death Ray; if the save isfailed, the humanoid dies within a day."

      "Description": "Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of wolves. They often embrace finery and decadence and may assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no reflections in mirrors. They speak any languages they knew in life. A vampire can charm anyone who meets its gaze; a save vs. [spell]s is allowed to resist, but at a penalty of -2 due to the power of the charm. This charm is so powerful that the victim will not resist being bitten by the vampire. The bite inflicts 1d3 damage, then each round thereafter one energy level is drained from the victim. The vampire regenerates a 1d6 hit points (if needed) for each energy level drained. If the victim dies from the ENERGY DRAIN, he or she will arise as a vampire at the next sunset (but not less than 12 hours later). Vampires spawned in this way are under the permanent control of the vampire who created them. If using the bite attack, the vampire suffers a penalty of -5 to Armor Class due to the vulnerable position it must assume. For this reason, the bite is rarely used in combat. Vampires have great Strength, gaining a bonus of +3 to damage when using melee [weapons], and a vampire will generally choose to use a melee [weapon] (or even its bare hands) in combat rather than attempting to bite. Vampires are unharmed by non-magical [weapons], and like all undead are immune to sleep, charm and HOLD [spell]s. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the vampire is not destroyed, though it may appear to be. The vampire will begin to regenerate 1d8 hours later, recovering 1 hit point per turn, and resuming normal activity as soon as the first point is restored. Vampires command the lesser creatures of the night andonce per day can call forth 10d10 rats, 5d4 giant rats,10d10 bats, 3d6 giant bats, or a pack of 3d6 wolves(assuming any such creatures are nearby). Thesecreatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire forup to 1 hour.A vampire can assume the form of a giant bat or a direwolf at will, requiring one round to complete thetransformation. The flying movement listed is for the giantbat form. In animal form, the vampire can use the normalattacks for that form. It can't use its other powers while inanimal form, except that creatures summoned are stillcontrolled, and charms already in effect continue in effect.For all their power, vampires have a number ofweaknesses:Repelling a Vampire: Vampires cannot tolerate the strongodor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it.Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly presentedholy symbol. These things don’t harm the vampire – theymerely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay atleast 5 feet away from a creature HOLDing the mirror orholy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacksagainst the creature HOLDing the item for the rest of theencounter.Vampires are also unable to cross running water, althoughthey can be carried over it while resting in their coffins oraboard a ship. They are utterly unable to enter a home orother building unless invited in by someone with theauthority to do so. They may freely enter public places,since these are by definition open to all.Slaying a Vampire: Reducing a vampire’s hit points to 0or lower incapacitates it but doesn’t always destroy it, asdescribed above. However, certain attacks can slayvampires. Exposing any vampire to direct sunlightdisorients it: It can act for only one round and is destroyedutterly in the next round if it cannot escape. Similarly,immersing a vampire in running water robs it of one-thirdof its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the endof the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stakethrough a vampire’s heart instantly slays the monster.However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unlessthe body is destroyed, by water or sunlight as describedabove, or by burning it completely in a funeral pyre."

A ghost normally resembles the form it had in life,but sometimes the spiritual form is altered. For instance,the ghost of someone who believed he or she was evilmight look a bit demonic. Because they are incorporeal,ghosts may be hitonly by magical[weapons].Seeing a ghost is soterrible that the victimmust save vs. [spell]sor flee for 2d6rounds. A characteror creature whosuccessfully saves vs.a given ghost's fearattack may not be soaffected by that ghostagain, but of coursemay still be affectedby another.A ghost that hits aliving target with itstouch attack does 1d8points of damage and at the same time regenerates the same number of hitpoints. In addition, the victim loses 1 Constitution point.Elves and dwarves (and other long-lived creatures such asdragons) are allowed a saving throw vs. Death Ray toresist this effect, which must be rolled on each hit.Characters who lose Constitution appear to have aged. Ifa ghost is fighting a living creature which does not have aConstitution score, the GM should assign whatever scorehe or she sees fit.Lost Constitution can be regained at a rate of one pointper casting of restoration; nothing else (except a wish)can restore Constitution lost to a ghost. If a character'sConstitution falls to 0, he or she dies permanently andcannot be raised (but still may be reincarnated).Once per turn, a ghost can use telekinesis (as the [spell]) asif it were a 10th level Magic-User.Instead of attacking, a ghost may attempt to possess aliving creature. This ability is similar to a magic jar [spell](as if cast by a 10th level Magic-User), except that it doesnot require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost mustbe able to move into the target (so it is possible to outrunit). The target can resist the attack with a successful savevs. [spell]s. A creature that successfully saves is immune tobeing possessed by that ghost for 24 hours. If the savefails, the ghost enters the target's body and controls it;control may be maintained until the ghost chooses to leavethe victim's body, or until it is driven out by means of aremove curse [spell]. While it is possessing a livingcreature, a ghost may not use any of its [special] abilities."
